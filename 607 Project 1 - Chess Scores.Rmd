## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Chess Text file ELO tournment data - load from Github}
#Raw data link for gibhub file 
#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmalmr/Project-1-607/main/tournamentinfo.txt

#Assign chess data to chessresult and read/ extract 
chessresult <- getURL('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schmalmr/Project-1-607/main/tournamentinfo.txt')

extract_chessresults <- read.csv(text = chessresult)
 tibble (extract_chessresults)

 
```


Use R for Data Sciences approach (page 209) to divide the targeted data into individual variable targets to establish regex for each target to be pulled from the dataset.  

```{r establish the required regex requirements to pull the specific data}

# Identification of the index # and then name starting 2 spaces after |
regname <- "[[:digit:]]+\\s+[|](\\s+[:alpha:]+){2,}"
# extract player name from chess results
player_name <- unlist(str_extract_all(extract_chessresults,regname))

# The state is the white space with two capital alpha characters followed by space and | to end the section
regstate <- "(?<=\\s)[:upper:]{2}(?=\\s[|])"
# extract the state from the chess results file
state <- unlist(str_extract_all(extract_chessresults,regstate))


# Total points is the only figure with the characteristic of a digit-period(puncation) the digit and this is used to find the total points
regtotalpoints <-"[:digit:][:punct:][:digit:]"

#extract the points through string extract 
total_points <- unlist(str_extract_all(extract_chessresults,regtotalpoints))

# starting chess rating score for players 
rplayerstartingscore <- "(?<=R:\\s{1,2})[:digit:]+"
player_starting_score <- unlist(str_extract_all(extract_chessresults,rplayerstartingscore))


# pull out the players final scores
regplayersfinalscore <- "(?<=->\\s?)[:digit:]+"
player_final_score <- unlist(str_extract_all(extract_chessresults,regplayersfinalscore))


# Extract the games section from the file 
reggame <- "(?<=[|][:digit:][:punct:][:digit:][:space:]{1,2}[|]{1}).{42}"
game <- unlist(str_extract_all(extract_chessresults,reggame))

regdigit<-"(?<=[:alpha:]//s)[:digit:].{1,2}"



player_name
state
player_starting_score
total_points
game

# Create data frame with the various extracted columns
chess_table <- data.frame( player_name, state,  player_starting_score,
  player_final_score,total_points,game)


col_names <- c("game_1","game_2","game_3","game_4","game_5","game_6","game_7")
chess_table <- chess_table%>%
  separate(game,col_names,sep = "[|]")


chess_table %>%
  select(game_1, game_2,game_3,game_4,game_5,game_6,game_7)



```
```{r}



#format game columns as numeric 

chess_table$game_1 = as.numeric(gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", chess_table$game_1)) 
chess_table$game_2 = as.numeric(gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", chess_table$game_2))   
chess_table$game_3 = as.numeric(gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", chess_table$game_3)) 
chess_table$game_4 = as.numeric(gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", chess_table$game_4)) 
chess_table$game_5 = as.numeric(gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", chess_table$game_5)) 
chess_table$game_6 = as.numeric(gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", chess_table$game_6)) 
chess_table$game_7 = as.numeric(gsub(".*?([0-9]+).*", "\\1", chess_table$game_7)) 


index<-add_count(chess_table)

chess_table %>%
  select(player_starting_score,game_1, game_2,game_3,game_4,game_5,game_6,game_7)


chess_table$player_starting_score <- as.numeric(as.character(chess_table$player_starting_score))
chess_table$toal_points <- as.numeric(as.character(chess_table$total_points))


#Seperate the column of player name into player index and name
chess_table<-separate(data = chess_table, col = player_name, into = c("player_index", "Name"), sep = "\\|")

# convert index character to numberic
chess_table$player_index <- as.numeric(as.character(chess_table$player_index))
chess_table

#Create chess table to store opponent starting scores
chess_table_oppscores<-chess_table


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Developing approach to index against the player index and the game columns to find and replace with the approach starting player scores before taking row means

#chess_table_oppscores %>%
#if (chess_table_oppscores$player_index==chess_table_oppscores$game_1), #chess_table_oppscores$game_1==chess_table_oppscores$player_starting_score, #{chess_table_oppscores$game_1==0}


#chess_table_oppscores <- chess_table_oppscores %>% mutate (chess_table_oppscores$game_1 = case_when(chess_table_oppscores$player_index== chess_table_oppscores%game_1,TRUE ~ chess_table_oppscores$game1=chess_table_oppscores$player_starting_score))


#chess_table_oppscores %>%
#   gather(key = "player_index") %>%
#   left_join(lookup, by = "col_names") %>%
#   spread(key = player_index, value = player_starting_score)


result = chess_table_oppscores %>% 
  # need to add an overall average opponent pre rating when done above
  select(Name, state, total_points, player_starting_score) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  distinct()

# Store a csv

write_csv(result, "/Users/mark/607_Project_1_output.csv")
